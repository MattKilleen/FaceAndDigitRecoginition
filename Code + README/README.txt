Note from Tom (4/29):

Yo, I edited the files to convert them from Python 2 to Python 3. I also
deleted some files that I didn't think we'd need from the Berkeley resource, which can be
found at:

https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu//~cs188/sp11/projects/classification/classification.html

If there's any file you guys think we need that I deleted then you can fetch it from the
zip-file there. The only things I deleted were runMiniContest.py, answers.py, miniContest.py,
and mira.py. None of those should be interfering with the things we actually need to edit,
which I believe are naiveBayes.py, perceptron.py, and dataClassifier.py.

Not sure yet if we need commands.txt or projects.css, so I've kept them in for now.

I'm going to start looking at the Berkeley page for an in-depth description of everything
and then start working on Naive Bayes. You guys should look at the page too to see what
we're given and then you can either help with Naive Bayes or start on Perceptron or the
third algorithm that we get to choose.

We got this!
